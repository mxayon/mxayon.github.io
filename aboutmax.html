          "Hello World!"
          I am Maximo. A Full-Stack Web Engineer and Fledgling Data Detective. My curiosity of learning how to talk to computers sparked when I found an
          article about automator when I was re-labelling a huge batch of video files. I then had mac rumors and
          cult of mac on rss feed and soon enough was working at the apple store around the time the iphone 4s was launched.
          This was around the beginnig of the iphone and mac app store - I started curious about all the neat utilites that
          were utilized by different software as their main feature, not really sure how it was all connected but loved all the tools.
          One of my ultimate favorites was teaching the accesibilty features, mastered the updates and gestures which surprisingly turned
          into the most common troubleshooting issue. This got me promoted to the genius bar team and access to bunch of beta keys of new apps
          to test.
          <br>
          <br>
          I moved into using repair knowledge orchestrating repairs with depots on a broader scale, purely on a customer facing level.
          Chose to get good at the technical but still mostly GUI editing through video production. When I first ventured in to the world wide
          web develeopment world, It slowly but surely all started to connect and give importance to the intricsies of it all.
          <br>
          <br>
          Started as a software engineer who wanted to avoid math by all means but now after attempting to graple with some data science and
          machine learning topics am eager to chip away at all the statistics and probability courses available online.
