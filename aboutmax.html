          Hi,
          I am Maximo,
          a full stack developer
          studying design and data tools.
          I love making different components work well together. I have expereinced evolving through years of customer advocacy, seeing the importance of human computer interaction. I began
          my product service journey experiencing first hand the benefits of well
          thought out applications and the impact on peoples lives.
          My experience teaching an audience on how to use devices and software has amplified my respect for intentional design and how iterative optimization really makes things better for everyone in the long run. Iâ€™ve grown from multiple
          perspectives of product - consumer support,
          operation of support platform, to development.
          I dream of and respect complex systems, or a universe of intelligent solutions thoughtful enough to cover the unthinkable. I'm quick to pick up new things, and have learned to fill up my toolkit with skills that allow me to
          develop ideas into real life applications. Looking into data journalism as well has improved my learning abilities, more over a guide to share knowledge or looking into possible outcomes.
          <br>
          <br>
          I grew up in the Philippines and named myself after my grandfather. A Filipino-American who graduated MIT as an engineer and served in the US military. He wrote a paper: "The Economic Feasibility of an Electric Furnace in the Philippines"
          in the
          1940s. Possibly his college thesis and published at MIT. There isn't much data regarding the actual shift in manufacturing I could find, but can only gather an idea based on when the actual production started to boom. The paper was a few
          years before Japan
          switched from gas
          furnaces to electric for mass producing steel which was then adapted throughout Asia propelling a metalurgy boom in the 1950s.
          As a child I had a feeling my mom had superwoman powers as she juggled interior design projects for shopping centers with her work collegues while teaching me how to read Dr. Seuss. I then lived with my pops and his dads books. As the
          story goes,
          Manila was in ruins after WWII and at a time of healing after war. Schools and education were the first to get rebuilt, bringing in an influx of door to door book salesmen from america selling volumes of encylopedia britanicca, history
          books and
          atlases. My dad covered each book to preserve it, echoing his dads discipline for teaching from serving as dean in the architechture college. He always used these books in every chance he got to teach a lesson. When I was
          held back in school due to my chicken-scratch note-taking, he told me to re-write this Florence Nightingale biography book in scriptive handwriting. After my father passed, he left behind the collection at the Barangay
          Hall in his town. These stories, along with the different teachers I was lucky enough to learn from along the way, has structured my interests and
          resiliency to look at the intersections of design and engineering.
          <br>
          <br>
          The level of tools for exploration today, even with all the projections of Moore's law and re-calculations that allow us to visualize the progress, is mind blowing in action compared to before. Today we are lucky enough to see the effects
          of each improvement in real-time and
          we need to be resposible for the
          repurucssions. Everything goes back to the ideation phase and design in creation. I would love to make space to showcase designs scientific approach and how powerful it makes things when integrated on every level.
