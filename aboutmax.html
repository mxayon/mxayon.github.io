          Hi,
          I am Max! <br>
          A full stack web developer / designer studying data tools. I love making different components work well together. I have expereinced evolving through years of customer advocacy, seeing the importance of human computer interaction. I began
          my product service journey experiencing first hand the benefits of well
          thought out applications and the impact on peoples lives.
          My experience teaching an audience on how to use devices and software has amplified my respect for intentional design and how iterative optimization really makes things better for everyone in the long run. Iâ€™ve grown from multiple
          perspectives of product - consumer support,
          operation of support platform, to development.
          I dream of and respect complex systems, or a universe of intelligent solutions thoughtful enough to cover the unthinkable. I'm quick to pick up new things, and have learned to fill up my toolkit with skills that allow me to
          develop of my ideas into real life applications. Looking into data journalism as well has improved my learning abilities, more over a guide to share knowledge or looking into possible outcomes.
          <br>
          <br>
          I grew up in the philippines and named myself after my grandfather. He graduated MIT as an engineer and served in the US military as an engineer. He wrote a paper: "The Economic Feasibility of an Electric Furnace in the Philippines" in the
          1940s. A decade before Japan switched from gas furnaces to electric for mass produced steel. Tripling asia's metallurgy economy in the 1950s.
          As a child I knew my mom had superwoman powers as she juggled interior design projects for shopping centers while teaching me how to read Dr. Seuss. I then lived with my pops who was immersed in his fathers architechture books. My other
          grandpa was the dean of architechture for the Philippines' architechture college. After WWII in Manila, rebuilding from reparations of the bombs of war, schools and learning were the first things to improve. There was an influx of american
          book sales men selling whole volumes of encyclopedias and world atlases or history. My dad talked about the books like gold, covering each book to preserve it. He always used these books in every chance he got to teach a lesson. When I was
          held back in school due to my chicken-scratch handwriting, he told me to re-write this Florence Nightingale biography book in scriptive handwriting. After my father passed, he left behind the small public library, today located at the
          Barangay
          Hall in his town. Seeing my older brother
          relentlessly work on his drafting table till late at night gave me a real idea of what a purposeful profession looks like. These stories, along with the different teachers I was lucky enough to learn from, has structured my interests and
          resiliency.
          <br>
          <br>
          The level of tools for exploration today, even after reading new Moore's law re-implementations, is mind blowing in action. Today we are lucky enough to see the effects of each improvement in real-time and we need to be resposible for the
          repurucssions. Everything goes back to the ideation phase and design in creation. I would love to create design enviroments that champion the science that goes behind it.
