          Hi,
          I am Max! <br>
          A full stack web developer / designer studying data tools. I love making different components work well together.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am attracted to roles that allowed me to tinker and dive into complex systems. I love taking things apart and putting things back in order, while leaving ample notes along the way.
          I love the psychology behind tools and the ideation process behind solutions being integrated.
          <br>
          <br>
          I have expereinced evolving through years of customer advocacy, seeing the importance of human computer interaction. I began my product service journey experiencing first hand the benefits of well
          thought out applications and the impact on peoples lives.
          <br>
          <br>
          My experience teaching an audience on how to use devices and software has amplified my respect for intentional design and how iterative optimization really makes things better for everyone in the long run. Iâ€™ve grown from multiple
          perspectives of product - consumer support,
          operation of support platform, to development.
          I dream of and respect complex systems, or a universe of intelligent solutions thoughtful enough to cover the unthinkable solutions. I'm quick to pick up new things, and have learned to fill up my toolkit with skills that allow me to
          develop of my ideas into real life applications. Looking into data journalism as well has improved my learning abilities, more over a guide to share knowledge or looking into possible outcomes.
          <br>
          <br>
          The level of tools for exploration today, even if I keep reading about moore's law, is mind blowing in action. Today we are lucky enough to see the effects of each improvement in real-time and we need to be resposible for the
          repurucssions. Everything goes back to the ideation phase and design in creation. I would love to create design enviroments that champion the science that goes behind it.
