          "Hello World!"
          I am Maximo. A Full-Stack Web Engineer and fledgling Data Detective. My curiosity of learning how to talk to computers sparked when I found
          out about automator and learned how to re-label large batches of video files. As a video editor, I worked in the apple store since I was such a fan of FinalCut.
          It was around the beginning of the app store - and it sparked
          my obsession of figuring out all the neat utilites that different third-party software would come up with, not really sure how it was all connected.
          I loved sharing things like using the RSS feed and was constantly on cult of mac or the mac rumors forums.
          One of my ultimate favorites was teaching the accesibilty features, led me to master the gestures and updates which turned
          out to be (one of the)the most common troubleshooting issues. I got mobile repair certified and joined the genius bar team (as back then a mobile technician)
          and gained access to bunch of keys of beta apps to test.
          <br>
          <br>
          In line with troubleshooting, I then worked as a claims analyst for an electornics warranty company. Front-facing customer support but learned the importance
          of detailed documentation with every interacion and why a dynamic CRM is neccessary for that.
          Helped improve claim taking process specially for mobile devices to streamline quality and concise data gathering.
          <br>
          Started a solo video production endevour but then found the same sense of purpose in a finished product in the Web Dev world, and then some.
          I tasted the auto-magic magic and needed to know how it worked.
          It slowly but surely all started to connect and gave importance to the intricsies of it all. Quickly realized that I wasnt just in it for the front-end,
          Full-stack is so important and what we (are to/ can) do with data maybe a never-ending course.
          <br>
          <br>
          I was a software engineer who wanted to avoid math by all means but now after attempting to graple with some data science and
          machine learning topics am relentlessly tackling these pertinent math conecpts through khan and udemy. Piecing it all together would be to circle back to
          the foundations and master some data structures and algorithms.
          My blog serves as a resource / toolkit for myself and anyone else who would like to battle their math-phobia.
