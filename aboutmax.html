          Hello!
          I am Max! A self-actualized Product Designer, Cross-Dimensional Developer and Relentless Code Mechanic.
          I am emphatic about measuring change and understanding the factors that drive things.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am a hueristic visual-spatial learner. A Product Designer at heart, Empathy prioritist at core. I love the psychology behind tools. While I was reading about how Alan Turing connected Belousovâ€™s mixture, and Mandelbrot's Fractal set to
          self- singularity/ self-organizatoin, one day as he predicted Artificial Intelligence. On a human scale, if the core of computing is logic, and the core of "Cogito Ergo Sum" means we are instantiated when we realize ourselves, then the
          answers always lie where we start.
          <br>
          It is all in documenting where we came from to get some real evolving going on. Constant re-evaluating the collection and they way its presented in my head helps the road to transparancy light up.
          <br>
          I think there's a 4th dimension of depth that can provide some insight of how humans have evolved and react with
          machines. Looking at multiple date and time stamps gives out an overview effect, but the different branches of evolution makes it a full multi-dimensional image to comprehend in the brain.
          <br>
          It's easy to feel dizzy and astronauts come out and said that they have the same effect.
          <br>
          Successful exploration includes the plan to send back the message back to earth. It's existensially confusing to imagine where all the lost data has gone to throughout time.
          <br>
          The poetry of design in everything we do is the way we document and re-analyze things. Our own check and balance systems. Through this cycle, I have grave importance to working in a team and utilizing my abilities to grow from its
          evolution. I have a journey's worth of analysis in a multi-perspective sort of way about how to generally improve
          a passionate development lifecycle through my own rhythm.
