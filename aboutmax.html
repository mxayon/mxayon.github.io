          Hello!
          I am Max! A self-actualized Product Designer, Cross-Dimensional Developer and Continuity Assembler.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am emphatic about change and am not afraid to dive in and adapt it myself. I like to take things apart and
          put things back together in working order to get an idea of what I could do with it. I have spent 5 + years in the product
          operation phase and learned first hand how an end result is recieved, converting demoters to promoters via training, repair and maintenance.
          <br>
          <br>

          I owned the feedback loop cycle of a product problem, both mechanical and software. Peeling each mobile repair component, in order of the diagram while
          managing customers valuable data felt like working in an atomic energy plant, the importance of my work and the quality of attention to detail I
          am able to envision gave me a chance to hone my craft. I liked to think of myself as a doctor, I cant mess up someone's camera connection since
          they are taking the risk of loosing their data - even if after persisting to come back after data has been saved - it was the same principle
          across all products, albeit data transfer from a sale especially cross platform or legacy systems.
          <br>
          <br>
          I was able to experience working closer to the DevOps lifecycle, bringing the repair and training skill set to a remote, still customer focused
          zone. I learned to switch up my commuinication style to quick documentation of repair process I've kept on me as a repair doctor. I felt like a
          digital whisperer - it may sound like an ungrounded thought but it gave me the patience to problem solve even if everyone else thought it was dead,
          because those were my favorite moments. I kept the energy and repair standard with detailed suggestions and cure, from 5 years of repairing mobile
          products - hardware and software. Once I was recalibrated and adjusted to my telephony soft skills, I was able to really focus on the "surgical"
          part of my position I had tons of suggestions and joined my very first pilot team to roll out a new mobile claim filing process when the product was
          being restructured across all teams. I gathered test data on a spreadsheet before I understood what was going on before the new trail was launched.
          <br>
          <br>
          All the while I kept improving my design skills with photography, experimenting from digital to film and repairing components of a film camera. With
          photoshop and a basic understanding of flash animation, (I remember trying to bounce the ball and feeling disappointed at how glitchy and non-fluid
          editing keyframes back then felt.) I started assisting a video editor, and was able to solve his problem of over-exposed shots during daytime clips
          due to training myself on a macroscopic level in terms of still framed photography. I gained trust to finish each product from ideation to maintenance, and added another systematic layer I have implemented for my own process.
          <br>
          <br>
          I champoined short templated projects - I started with a loose rule of 15 - 6 mins or 3 - 2 songs, I looked for different
          effects and tricks to see if the viewers were paying attention but no matter how curated the content and composition is, there are other dimensons that
          will not always produce the same result. A concise 3-5 min, (depending on artistic liscence) 1 song rule. I found establishing my own set of rules
          that made sense and had Continuity through out the lifecycle process of the product, interdependant but relational. it becomes easy to establish or communicate the common goal for the the product objectives beteween processes. Most times
          re-arranging the wheel can be more fruitful than re-inventing it, other times its best to start with a blank slate. I'm confindent that these rules have helped me gain a need for my craft in my clients, as well as the "beta" layer for
          their loyalty.
          <br>
          <br>
          Launching into coding, excited by the tooling concept I wanted to pick up all the things, feeling like a language would talk to me naturally but I was
          wrong. I took on the challenge and by process of elimination tackled almost all aspects of my curiosity to not give up. I found all roads route back
          to the core foundations. "Cogito Ergo Sum" and revisiting what I kept trying to do, dismantling the structure inorder to re-assemble and recalibrate
          which options work best.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am a hueristic spatial learner that has learned its not enough to be thoughtful during experimentation but litigious since there
          will always be underlying wisdom in the structure but it is all in the moment of catching and identifing the right issue to solve.
