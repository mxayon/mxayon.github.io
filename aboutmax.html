          "Hello World!"
          I am Maximo. A Full-Stack Web Engineer and fledgling Data Detective. My curiosity of learning how to (really) talk to computers sparked when I found
          out about automator and learned how to use it to re-label a huge batch of video files. I then had mac rumors and
          cult of mac on rss feed and soon enough was working at the apple store around the time the iphone 4s was launched.
          Looking back, it was the beginning of the iphone and mac app store - the peak of my obsession of all the neat utilites that different software
          could program their mac to do as their main feature, not really sure how it was all connected but loved all the tools.
          One of my ultimate favorites was learning and teaching the accesibilty features, mastered the updates and gestures which surprisingly turned
          into the most common troubleshooting issue. This is the obsession that got me promoted to the genius bar team (as back then a mobile technician)
          and gained access to bunch of beta keys of new apps to test.
          <br>
          <br>
          In line with troubleshooting, I then worked as a claims analyst for an electornics warranty company.
          Daily tickets, high traffic flow of support calls. My main duties were orchestrating repairs with depots on a broader scale,
          but purely on a customer facing level. Helped improve claim taking system specially for mobile devices to streamline quality and concise data gathering.
          Chose to try to create things on my own. Video production allowed me to love and hate the rendering process of machines again.
          When I first ventured in to the world wide web develeopment zone, I felt right at home in the sandbox playing with the lego pieeces (code) to build things.
          It slowly but surely all started to connect and give importance to the intricsies of it all. Quickly realized that I wasnt just in it for the front-end,
          Full-stack is so important and what to do with data maybe a never-ending course.
          <br>
          <br>
          Started as a software engineer who wanted to avoid math by all means but now after attempting to graple with some data science and
          machine learning topics am eager to chip away at all the statistics and probability courses available online. I'm keeping my blog to serve as
          a resource for myself and anyone else who would like to battle their math-phobia.
