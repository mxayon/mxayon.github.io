          "Hello World!"
          I am Maximo. A Full-Stack Web Engineer and fledgling Data Detective. My curiosity of talking to computers started when I found
          out about automator and re-labeled a large batch of video files.
          As a video editor, I found working at the apple store enhanched my problem-solving toolkit.
          Around the time of the iPhone4s launch - so did my obsession of figuring out all the neat utilites that different third-party software would come up with,
          not really sure how it was all connected.
          I got mobile repair certified and joined the genius bar team (FRS mobile technician)
          and gained access to bunch of keys of beta apps to test.
          <br>
          <br>
          In line with troubleshooting, I then worked as a claims analyst for an electornics warranty company.
          Front-facing customer support and learned the importance
          of detailed documentation with every interacion and why a dynamic CRM is neccessary for that.
          Helped improve claim taking process specially for mobile devices to streamline quality and concise data gathering.
          <br>
          <br>
          Ventured full time into video production but then found a greater sense of purpose in a finished product in the Web Dev world, and then some.
          I tasted the auto-magic magic and needed to know how it worked.
          It slowly but surely all started to connect and gave importance to the intricsies of it all.
          Quickly realized that I wasnt just in it for the Front-end (not to be taken lightly, sometimes feels like a surgical operation),
          Full-stack is crucial and what we (are to/ can) do with data maybe a never-ending course.
          <br>
          <br>
          As a software engineer with little interest in math, I missed out on the true nature of programming languages.
          Attempts to graple with data science and machine learning topics
          wont work without an interest in statistics and probability, the end in mind beggining with finishing more pertinent math conecpts on khan and udemy.
          All the while not forgetting to commit an essential variable to the code equation - data structures and algorithms.
          <br>
          <br>
          My <a href="https://mxnkpl.com/blog"> blog </a>
          serves as a resource / toolkit for myself and anyone else who would like to battle their math-phobia and other cool coding things.
