          Hello!
          I am Max! A self-actualized Product Designer, Cross-Dimensional Developer and Relentless Code Mechanic.
          I am emphatic about measuring change and understanding the factors that drive things.
          I am a hueristic visual-spatial learner. A Product Designer at heart, Empathy prioritist at core.
          <br>
          I love the psychology behind tools. Alan Turing connected Belousovâ€™s mixture (energy in sugar consupmtion), and Mandelbrot's Fractal set to
          Self-Singularity/ Self-Organization, -exponentially today as Artificial Intelligence- and has refragmated our sequential un-evolving view into the quantum computing age..
          <a href="https://mxnkpl.com/blog/2019-alan-turing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">(my blog post on Turing)</a>
          <br>
          In a birds-eye view of human-evolution - with life cycles in different scales, if the core of computing is logic,
          "Cogito Ergo Sum" means we create our own possibilities when we realize ourselves. We are propelled to sapiently construct ourselves into revolutionary cycles in different speeds and momentum. When objects collide in motion, the impact is
          cushioned if the
          objects - change or new develoment - are moving at their own constant speed. Being adapatable and knowing the behaviors of a tipping point is also a tool humans can look at to create a shared wisdom of adapting.
          <br>
          It is all in documenting where we came from to get some real evolving going on. Constantly re-evaluating the connections and how they intertwine in my pre-computer head helps the road to transparency light up.
          <br>
          I think there's a 4th dimension of depth that can provide some insight of how humans have evolved and react with
          machines. Looking at multiple date and time stamps zoomed out gives out a dizzying effect, but the different branches of evolution makes it a full multi-dimensional image to comprehend in the brain.
          <br>
          (Click on the Alarm Clock to get the

          <br>
          It's easy to understand the "Overview Effect" that astronauts said that they felt in outer space.
          <br>
          Successful exploration includes the plan to get the message back to earth. It's existensially-confusing to imagine where all the lost data has gone to throughout time.
          <br>
          The poetry of design in everything we do is the way we document and re-analyze things. Our own check and balance systems. Through this cycle, I have grave importance to working in a team and utilizing my abilities to grow from its
          evolution. I have a journey's worth of analysis in a multi-perspective sort of way about how to generally improve
          a passionate development lifecycle through my own rhythm.
